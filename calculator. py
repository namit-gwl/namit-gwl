This is a calculator made by me 
hope you like it 


def plus(a,b):
          value1 = a + b
          print(value1)

def minus(a,b):
          value2 = a - b
          print(value2)
          
def multi(a,b):
          value3 = a * b
          print(value3)
          
def divid(a,b):
          value4 = a / b
          print(value4)
          

st1 = "welcome to the irfan's calclulator"
print(st1.center(100))
print("enter any two numbers of which you want to know the answer")
a = int(input("enter the first number :"))
b = int(input("enter the second number :"))
d = int(input('''enter the numbers to choose the symbole :
              "1" is for addition
              "2" is for subtraction
              "3" is for multiplication

match d:
